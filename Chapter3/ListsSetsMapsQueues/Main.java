/* Collection
* 
* is a group of objects contained in a single object. The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes in java.util for storing collections. 
* There are four main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework:
*
* List: A list is an ordered collections of elements that allow duplicate entries. Elements in a list can be accessed by an int index.
* Set: A set is a collection that does not allow duplicated entries.
* Queue: A queue is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing.
      A typical queue processes its elements in a FIFO, first in first out order but other orderings are possible
* Map: A map is a collection tat maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed. The elements in a map are key/value pairs.
