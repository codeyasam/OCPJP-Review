/* Adding Internalization and Localization 
*
* Internationalization - is the process of designing your program so it can be adapted.
* Localization - means actually supporting multiple locales. Oracle defines a locale as "a specific geographical, political or cultural region."

* Localization includes translating strings to different langages. It also includes outputting dates and numers in the correct format for that locale. 
* Internationalization and Localization is often referred as i18n and l10n. The number refers to the number of characters between the first and last characters, in other words, the number of characters that are replaced with a number.
